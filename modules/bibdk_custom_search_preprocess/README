Module for handling combined search form values.

Since the form element ID's are different for each website,
the search pre-process and javascript attach functions need to be maintained seperately.

For example:
'Select year' is two select elements - a 'select operator' ('=','<=' or '=>'), plus a year selector ('2012','2011','2010',[...]), and it needs to be combined into a single search statement ('year=2012', year<=1978, [...]).
