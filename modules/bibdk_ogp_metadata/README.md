We'd like to add metadata to pages - mainly to show some nice previews on links from other sites. ogp (open graph protocol)
seems to be widely used (facebook, dr.dk etc.)

There are four required properties for every page - from ogp.me:

    og:title - The title of your object as it should appear within the graph, e.g., "The Rock".
    og:type - The type of your object, e.g., "video.movie". Depending on the type you specify, other properties may also be required.
    og:image - An image URL which should represent your object within the graph.
    og:url - The canonical URL of your object that will be used as its permanent ID in the graph, e.g., "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/".

besides that there are a number of optional properties @see https://ogp.me/
