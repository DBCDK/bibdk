The module customize the default search by adding form elements to the search-block-form, based on the page path.

In the administration interface you can edit the values of form elements, make nested checkbox or radio button values, combine form elements into a single search element, add search elements to a search page, and assign a search page to a path.

Search pre-process and javascript for combined form values are mantained seperately, in bibdk_custom_search_preprocess (or any module that implements hook_bibdk_custom_search_field_preprocess().)

When adding <a href='admin/config/search/bibdk_custom_search/values'>custom values</a> for searchpages use english cql language (even though the rest might be written in another language eg. danish) e.g. (fra or fre)
