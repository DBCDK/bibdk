 * Plugin to provide an argument handler for a bibdk_newsroom_context.

 * Given any argument to the page, bibdk_newsroom_context will get it
 * and turn it into a piece of data (a "context") just by adding some text to it.
 * Normally, the argument would be a key into some database (like the node
 * database, for example, and the result of using the argument would be to load
 * a specific "context" or data item that we can use elsewhere.
