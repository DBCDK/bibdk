<h1>Bibliotek.dk Autocomplete</h1>

<p>
The suggestion service returns auto completion suggestions from the Solr-index of the Data Well that can be used for consecutive searches.
</p>

<p>
The service currently has two operations: Terms and Facets
</p>

<h2>Terms</h2>

<p>
Accessible through <context root>/rest/terms path on the service.
</p>

<p>
Retrieve suggestions based on the Solr TermsComponent, including frequency data of how often words or phrases occur in the specified index, which indicates how many objects in the Data Well that match the query.
</p>

<p>
Term indexes return only single terms while phrase indexes return entire phrases. Entries in the specified index that begin with the specified query string are returned. For term indexes the query string can only contain one term. Phrase indexes can be queried with strings consisting of multiple terms.
</p>

<p>
Required parameters:<br/>
<code>query</code> The string to find suggestions for<br/>
<code>index</code> The index to find suggestions in<br/>
</p>

<p>Examples:<br/>
http://<hostname and service path>/rest/terms?query=goblet&index=scanterm.title<br/>
http://<hostname and service path>/rest/terms?query=harry+potter&index=scanphrase.title<br/>
</p>

<h2>Facets</h3>
<p>
Accessible through <context root>/rest/facets path on the service.
</p>

<p>
Retrieve suggestions based on the Solr Facets, including frequency data of how often words or phrases occur in the specified index, which indicates how many objects in the Data Well that matches each of the returned facets.
</p>

<p>
This variant looks in the specified index for entries that contain the words from specified query string and then counts results in groups based on the specified facet index. This will also provide suggestions for phrases that contain the words from the query string.
</p>

<p>
Care should be taken in selecting a suitable pair of indexes. The facet index should be an index generated from the same data as the match index. The match index should be a term index and the facetIndex should be a phrase index. If the chosen facet index contain data different from the match index, the returned suggestions may not contain the required query.
</p>

<p>
Required parameters:<br/>
<code>query</code> The prefix string to find suggestions for<br/>
<code>index</code> The index to find matches in<br/>
<code>facetIndex</code>  The index to find suggestions in<br/>
</p>

<p>Examples:<br/>
http://<hostname and service path>/rest/facets?query=goblet+fire&index=scanterm.mainTitle&facetIndex=scanphrase.mainTitle
