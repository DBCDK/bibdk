Tests folder holds all selenium tests for bibliotek.dk. All tests extend BibdkUnitTestCase which resides in helpers.py. Helpers.py
has some sensitive information which is not to be opensourced, so it resides in its own private git - you can find it here: gitlab@gitlab.dbc.dk:d-scrum/d7/BibdkWebdriver.git
